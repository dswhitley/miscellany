# Guidelines
##***[WIP] This is a work in progress...and probably always will be[WIP]***
This is my attempt at a "style" guide.  It is originally intended for Ansible,
but might eventually include other items as well so I will leave the title
purposely generic.

It is important to note that my work may not currently comply with all style
guide rules within, but the intention is that it will eventually.  It is really
going to be just for my reference and an attempt at standardization (which
historically fails as I learn more and adopt different techniques...).

Also note that this is largely personal.
